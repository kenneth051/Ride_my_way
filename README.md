# Ride_my_way
repository for carpooling website
i have used html, css and  a alittle javascript to just navigate from one page to another, i have also provided dummy data to just show how the application will work when a database is added to it.
included (app.py) are APIs built to over see the functionality of the website but are not yet fully done and intergrated to the UI
